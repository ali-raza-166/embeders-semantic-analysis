Semantic similarity analysis is the process of measuring how similar the meanings of different pieces of text are. This study introduces a structured approach to compare words, phrases, sentences, and documents using OpenAI's GPT embeddings. The method utilizes cosine similarity,which measures the angular distance  between the numerical representations of the pieces of text. Experiments demonstrate the influence of text structure and content on the resulting similarity scores, revealing patterns that align with human understanding. The results are presented through clear visualizations created in Excel, levaraging CSV files for efficient data handling and chart creation. These visualizations highlight effectively the value of this approach for tasks like semantic search and recommendations.
