# Introduction
This project introduces a generalized model for semantic similarity analysis using cosine similarity, dimensionality reduction (PCA and t-SNE), and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. Built around the PESTLE framework, the model supports 1D, 2D, and 3D visualizations to compare words with phrases, PDFs, and datasets. High-dimensional embeddings (1536 dimensions) are reduced for effective visualization via scatter plots and heatmaps. The RAG approach integrates Pinecone for efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings, enabling accurate and contextually relevant responses from a large language model (LLM). The model also supports multilingual analysis and extends to recommendation systems for personalized suggestions. This C# .NET implementation demonstrates effective retrieval, visualization, and recommendation generation based on semantic similarity.
